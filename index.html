                    <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</h1>
                    artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to
                    perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the
                    project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such
                    as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the
                    development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be
                    programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical
                    theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer
                    processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility
                    over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge.On the other hand, some programs
                    have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain
                    specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as
                    diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.
